# Quasar App

- look at localhost:8081/profile for now
- design has changed 
- rest components will be looked after shortly

`chooseServices` in `components/add` has UI to create invoice
until now there is UI for enterprise but for clients and admin same UI element can be used


`LFooter.vue` is for landing page only and `Footer.vue` is for Sticky button

i am currently looking inside [https://github.com/kefranabg/bento-starter]. this has vuex, vue and firebase with firebase authentication
